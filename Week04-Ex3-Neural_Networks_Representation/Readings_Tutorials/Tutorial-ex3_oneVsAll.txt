Tutorial: ex3 oneVsAll() - Tom Mosher

Summary:

    The goal of the oneVsAll.m function is to learn a set of theta vectors. Each vector is trained to recognize one label.

    So you create a for-loop over the number of labels.

    Inside the for-loop, you call fmincg() to get the theta value, then save it in the all_theta matrix.

    The oneVsAll.m script template contains several Hints and a code example to guide your work.  

Additional tips:

    all_theta is a matrix, where there is a row for each of the trained thetas. In the exercise example, there are 10 rows, of 401 elements each. Note that the submit grader's test case doesn't have 401 elements or 10 rows - your function must work for any size data set - so use the "num_labels" variable.

    Each call to fmincg() returns a theta vector. Be sure you use the lambda value provided in the function header.

    You then need to copy that vector into a row of all_theta.

    Inside the call to fmincg(), the "y == c" statement creates a vector of 0's and 1's for each value of 'c' as you iterate from 1 to num_labels. Those are the effective 'y' values that are used for training  to detect each label.

    Type these commands in your workspace to see how to copy a vector into a matrix:

        Q = zeros(5,3)      % create a test matrix of all-zeros
        v = [1 2 3]'        % create a column vector
        Q(2,:) = v          % copy v into the 2nd row of Q
        The syntax "(2,:)" means "use all columns of the 2nd row".
