Making plotDecisionBoundary.m a little more useful - Tom Mosher

The plotDecisionBoundary.m function is hard-coded for the range of X values that are used in the ex2 programming exercise.

You can modify the function so it works for more general purposes by:


% insert this code before line 17
dx = range(X(:,2)) * 0.02;

% comment out this line and replace
% allows the line to scale with the data set
%plot_x = [min(X(:,2))-2,  max(X(:,2))+2];
plot_x = [min(X(:,2))-dx,  max(X(:,2))+dx];

% comment-out this line
%axis([30, 100, 30, 100])

This isn't a graded function, so you can modify it without impacting your course grade.
