The code you add to predictOneVsAll.m can be as little as two lines:

one line to calculate the sigmoid() of the product of X and all_theta. X is (m x n), and all_theta is (num_labels x n), so you'll need a transposition to get a result of (m x num_labels) 

one line to return the classifier which has the max value. The size will be (m x 1). Use the "help max" command in your workspace to learn how the max() function returns two values. 

Note that your function must return the predictions as a column vector - size (m x 1). If you return a row vector, the script will not compute the accuracy correctly.

==========++++++++++==========
Question:
    Why do we use the max(sigmoid(htheta), [], 2) function? I din't understand why we need to use the max function and what exactly are we doing in htheta = X * all_theta' step. Although I had an intuition and got the answer,I din't understad the steps exactly.
    
Answer:
    Each row of all_theta is the theta coefficients learned for the i-th class, right? So all_theta is a k by n matrix, where k is the number of classes and n is the number of features. X is the sample matrix and each of its m rows is one sample with n features. So here's the dimensional analysis on X * all_theta':

    m by n times n by k yields m by k output.

    So each row of the output is gives the output of the hypothesis function for that row of X and each of the k possible classifiers. If you then pick the max by column (which is what the 2 in the third argument to the max function means), then you get the max value and (more importantly) the index giving the max value of each row. That index is the number of the class that is the most likely guess for the given sample. I left out the "sigmoid" in there, but you know what I mean. Because sigmoid is monotonic, it actually doesn't change the index you get.
    
==========++++++++++==========

The max() function returns two values. 

The first is the max values 

The second is the indexes of the max values. 

You want the second one as your predictions. So you can use [v p] = max(...).

Hi all, 

My OnevsAll  and IrCostFunction has been marked correctly, but my prediction code does not return the correct values. 

Sigmoid(X*all_theta') returns a 16x4 matrix.

I then proceed to use p= max(prediction,[],2).

Any ideas?

Thanks

The max() function returns two values. 

The first is the max values 

The second is the indexes of the max values. 

You want the second one as your predictions. So you can use [v p] = max(...).

Try find out the maximum h(x) row wise. once you are done, copy that result into the p vector. That is your result.

I am getting a training set accuracy of 10 even though the grader accepted my submission. I used a for-loop for the implementation, iterating it from 1 to the number of training examples. For each row I found out the column number for the maximum value and updated 'p' with this value of the column number. Where am I going wrong?

Iâ€‹ was also getting a training set accuracy of 10; I discovered that all-theta had not been picking up the output of fmincg correctly, so it was still a matrix of zeros. So the max function then sets the max value at index position 1 for all entries...hope this helps someone in the future!

None of the correct labels are zeros -because the images of the zero digits are encoded as the value 10. So in the exercise data set, the labels range from 1 to 10.

However, the grader only uses labels 1 through 4. So if you've done something to map the 10 labels to 0, then the grader will never notice that error.

 i experienced the same issue where, as Paul said, there was something wrong with All theta. So i ran this code again:


and then proceeded to run the prediction code again and i got the correct output (94.86 training accuracy instead of 10). Hope it helps anyone encountering this issue :).

I think when i write a = sigmoid(X*all_theta'), it results into a m x num_labels matrix which generally means it has the values of h(x) for 10 labels. Now the function of prediction is to find the maximum of all 10 classifiers.  

Well when i write                     a = sigmoid(X*all_theta'); p = max(a,[],2); it should result into mx1 column vector.

It stills gives me a zero accuracy that means it went wrong somewhere. Can you please relate to it?

When you use max() on a matrix, you have to provide for both return values.

The first return value is the maximums - you don't care about those.

The second return value is the index where the maximum was found. Those are your predicitons.

Hitarth Bhatt avatar

Well max(a,[],2) should return a matrix of length mx1. As it finds maximum row wise.

How are you saving the two return values?

Tom Mosher avatar

That is...

the vector of maximum values, and 

the vector of the indexes for the maximum values

Hitarth Bhatt avatar

I guess when i write [x,y]= max(a,[],2) the maximum values or the indices end up in  vector y.

Tom Mosher avatar

The maximum values would be in 'x'.

The indexes of the maximum values would be in 'y'. Those are the predictions, so you can use 'p' instead of 'y' there.

I'm still confused what the "DIM" 2 is specifying.

If we wanted to sum columns, would it be max([],A,2)?

Tom Mosher avatar

The max() function doesn't perform a sum.

1) The representation of all_theta here is different--each row represents 401 parameters corresponding to the 401 features.

2) The help doc in Octave is not very well written. Here max(A, [], 2) means maximum of a row of the matrix A, with the second dimension (2), i.e., all the columns of for a given row. [] represents a matrix as opposed to a vector.

3) The index tells us which element among the 10 is maximum.

Got this to work and accepted successfully, but baffled by what is going on. If you can elaborate, it would help my understanding.

1) By reading the first bullet, Z would be X (m x n) times all_theta' (n x num_labels), which i thought made sense for matrix multiplication rules (n = n), however, I did not get the test case answers even with the same code-- I get only 1 and 3 (which I can make into a column vector.) I had to swap the order and transpose. In one of the prior exercises, we said Z = X * theta. Why not here?

2) In addition, try as I might reading help max, I cannot understand the significance of max(A, [], 2). I got it to work with out it, but cannot figure out [] and 2 represent.

3) Also, I'm not sure why the max "Index" is being used.

Hi, Tried two line of codes as suggested, 

hofx = sigmoid fn of product of x and theta 

[val,p]= max of hofx as syntax for max function.

but while submitting one vs all is only running.. not predictone vs all function. Am i missing anything very basic? please guide

You run the exercise scripts to test your functions.

You run the submit script for grading.

Hi mentors. I have gotten full marks for first 2 assignments (lrCostFunction.m and oneVsAll.m) 

Currently working on predictOneVsAll.m, i am stuck.

I am working on the 2 lines of codes as per Tom's tutorial. currently, my assignment is returning me: a column vector with various numbers within a column vector thats 16x1.

But i am not getting the marks for it. May I know what is going wrong?

I had also used the the test case for predictOneVsAll (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/5g8LaZTCEeW0dw6k4EUmPw) , it returned 2 answers:

"ans: 1.0000; 0.2689; 0.8808; 0.9991" and "ans: 0; 0 ; 0 ; 0". Instead of getting an answer that's [1; 2; 2; 1]

Mentors, can kindly help me see what went wrong here?

You are posting in the thread for the tutorial on the predictOneVsAll() function. There is no cost calculation required.

Can you tell me why we use index value again ? How does it give the best match ?

Tom Mosher avatar
Tom Mosher

It's just a handy coincidence that the index numbers are the same as the value of the digits we're classifying. We use the classifier with index 1 to identify the digit '1', the classifier with index 2 for the digit '2', etc. The only exception is that we use the index 10 to represent the digit '0', since the index value 0 isn't allowed in MATLAB/Octave.

In general, we would normally have to convert the index values into what they represent, maybe using a lookup table. But we can skip that step in this exercise.

I got 95% prediction accuracy. 

But," [dummy, p]=max (..)" - this line confuses me a bit. We take the max value and store it in p right? How does it predict ? 

what do we mean by dummy and what does it do?

Thanks.   

Tom Mosher avatar

No, we store the max value in "dummy", and the index of the max value in p. The variable name "dummy" isn't important, you can use any name you like. We totally ignore the values we store there. The index values is what we want.

Hi @Tom Mosher

I have stumbled over a small curiosity that I hope you can help me with.

My first version of predictOneVsAll is working perfectly fine despite not using the sigmoid function at all.

It has two lines:

One line that calculates the multiplication of the theta values and the input values

One line that returns the classifier with the max value

This is really similar to what you suggest in the start of this thread, save the sigmoid function. Is this working because the sigmoid function is not really needed, as we are just looking for the number with the largest value (instead of the binary 0 or 1 that we are using later on in the neural network were the sigmoid function are indeed needed)?

Tom Mosher avatar

Good question.

Since the sigmoid function is monotonic increasing, you can find the correct classification either with it or without it, at least for the purposes of this exercise. You'll get the same result.

Since we're doing logistic classification, the method formally expects the outputs to in the range for logical values - between 0 and 1. Whether to include the sigmoid function depends on what you may use the results for in some future application.

I'm testing my code using the small test case provided and I've misunderstood something about how h_theta_X is calculated:

123
all_theta = [1 -6 3; -2 4 -3];
X = [1 7; 4 5; 7 8; 1 4];
predictOneVsAll(all_theta, X)
I hand calculate h_theta_X for the second input set (1, 4, 5) by first multiplying the theta matrix with the input set to get:

1
[1 - 24 - 15; -2 + 16 -15]
both of which are less than 0.5 so the sigmoid returns 0 for both - which means that h_theta_X is [0, 0] means that it wasn't able to classify it.

I'm kind of unsure of where I'm going wrong here.

Tom Mosher avatar
Tom Mosher

The sigmoid() function doesn't have a 0.5 threshold. It just returns the value.

In predictOneVsAll() we want to return the classifier with the highest value, regardless of whether it is greater or less than 0.5.

The 0.5 threshold is only used in logistic regression where you have two classes. It is not part of the sigmoid function itself.

Hello,

I just want to make sure why I'm interested in using the MAX:

normally if i had one class prediction i would have compare the predicted value against 0.5

p>0.5 => it is true else it is false.

However in this exercise we have multiple results greater than 0.5 therefore we are looking for the closest prediction to 1 (implemented by max).

with this implementation even if all results predict lower than 0.5 we will get some result.

Is the explanation correct?

thanks ahead!

Tom Mosher avatar
Tom Mosher

Mostly right. You do not care whether any of the predictions are > 0.5 You simply use the one with the maximum value.

Same confusion. Since we are predicting the accuracy, we should judge whether the number returned by sigmoid is >=0.5 or not, which is similar as what predict.m in ex2 doing. If yes, the classifier should be put to p, otherwise it means the record doesn't belong to any classifier and we can put 0 instead. After that return p to pred.

Without using condition, my accuracy is 94.92% but with it, it is just 89.64%. I think the latter number makes more sense.

Tom Mosher avatar
Tom Mosher

You're not predicting the accuracy. You are predicting the confidence that a given example is a member of a specific class.

When you have two classes and one logistic output, you split them using a fixed threshold.

When you have multiple classes and multiple outputs, you do not use a fixed threshold. You select the class that gives you the highest value.
