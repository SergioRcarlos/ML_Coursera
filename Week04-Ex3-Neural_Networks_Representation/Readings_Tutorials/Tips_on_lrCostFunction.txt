When completed, this function is identical to your costFunctionReg() from ex2, but using vectorized methods. See the ex2 tutorials for the cost and gradient - they use vectorized methods. 

ex3.pdf tells you to first implement the unregularized parts, then to implement the regularized parts. Then you test your code, and then submit it for grading. 

Do not remove the line "grad = grad(:)" from the end of the lrCostFunction.m script template. This line guarantees that the grad value is returned as a column vector.
