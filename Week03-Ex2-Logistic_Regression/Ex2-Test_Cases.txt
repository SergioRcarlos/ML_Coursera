Test Cases for sigmoid() and predict()

In previous versions of this course we were lucky enough to be provided with unit tests to test our functions for mistakes / errors before submitting them (Maybe Tom might want to bring some of his older ones back?).

For those of you who don't know, unit testing is essentially the practice of testing functions in your code to make sure they work as expected. You can determine if your functions are working properly by cross-referencing your answers with the answers below. This helps identify any failures in your algorithms / logic.

I've provided a few of my own below. Hope this helps some of you out!

(Mentor comment: This thread is closed to comments. If you have a question, please post it in a new thread. Include a copy of the test case you used and your results when you post your question.)

------------------------------

>> sigmoid(-5)
ans =  0.0066929

>> sigmoid(0)
ans =  0.50000

>> sigmoid(5)
ans =  0.99331

>> sigmoid([4 5 6])

Note: If you do not get these result, check that you are including the sigmoid() function, and that the decision threshold is >= 0.5

Hello classmates!

I have an issue with costFunctionReg.m. I'm sure that i've write right the formula.

with the tests

12345
X = [ones(3,1) magic(3)];
y = [1 0 1]';
theta = [-2 -1 1 2]';
[j g] = costFunctionReg(theta, X, y, 3)

ans =

j = 7.6832

g =

0.3172

-0.1277

2.6481

4.2379

1
[j g] = costFunctionReg(theta, X, y, 5)
ans =

j = 9.6832

g =

0.3172

-0.7944

3.3148

5.5712

i'm getting 

(test1) j =  7.7162 (difference: 0,033 from the 'right' result)

g = 

0.31722

  -0.12768 

   2.64812 

   4.23787

and

(test 2) j =  9.7162 (difference: 0,033 again! from the 'right' result)

g = 

0.31722

  -0.79435 

   3.31479 

   5.57121

and when i submit it, i get error only at Regularized Logistic Regression Cost, 85/100. 

Any help please? i think its somehow a bug ..

Hi, Giannis.

Interesting! Since you pass the unregularized cost part of the exercise and also the regularized gradient, there's only one place the bug could be:  in the regularization term for the cost. There aren't very many moving parts in that calculation. You obviously handled the ignoring of theta(1) for the gradient regularization and if you mistakenly include that in your cost regularization, it makes a way bigger error than -0.033.

I modified my code to print out the regularization term for the cost separately and called it Jreg. Here are my results on the two test cases:

>> [j g] = costFunctionReg(theta, X, y, 3)

Jreg =

     3

j =

    7.6832

g =

    0.3172

   -0.1277

    2.6481

    4.2379

>> [j g] = costFunctionReg(theta, X, y, 5)

Jreg =

     5

j =

    9.6832

g =

    0.3172

   -0.7944

    3.3148

    5.5712

Are you sure that you didn't change your cost code (the unregularized part) between the costFunction.m version and the costFunctionReg.m file? The base cost calculation is exactly the same and you just add in the regularization term in the second case.

Giannis Milogiannakis avatar

Thank very much for the quick response! 

Well  I modified my code with your way and the outputs were:  

>> [j g] = costFunctionReg(theta, X, y, 3)

j = 3

g =

0.31722

-0.12768

2.64812

4.23787

>> [j g] = costFunctionReg(theta, X, y, 5)

j = 5

g =

0.31722

-0.79435

3.31479

5.57121

Yes i just copied the code from the costFunction and i added the regularization. 

Is there any way to show you my code ?

I set theta(1) = 0 after the code of hypothesis and before the code of J(Θ).

I'm wondering if its about the version of Octave (4.0.0), i don't know...

Paul Mielke avatar
Paul Mielke

There are several ways to interpret your statement about theta(1) = 0. Note that the unregularized portion of J is calculated with the real value of theta(1), right? It's only in the regularization term that you zero it out.

Paul Mielke avatar
Paul Mielke

6 years ago

In other words, you code should look like:

Do exactly what you did in costFunction.m, then set theta(1) = 0 and compute the regularization terms for J and gradient. Then add the regularization terms to J and gradient, right?

Giannis Milogiannakis avatar
Giannis Milogiannakis
6 years ago

At the unregularized portion of J, i use the "h" as hypothesis (which i had set it before with the sigmoid function). And i use "theta" at the regularization part.

So the theta(1) = 0 effect only at regularization.

my code is below: 

h = ...(sigmoid function);

theta(1) = 0;

J = unregularized part (copy from costFunction) + regularization part;

grad = ...

----------

I used the command sum on theta^2 , its bad or?

Paul Mielke avatar
Paul Mielke

6 years ago

I assume you mean "sum(theta.^2)", right? That should be fine, since you have previously set theta(1) = 0. Also I seriously doubt this would be an Octave 4.0.0 issue, but I suppose you never know. Do you have access to older versions? I've had good results from Octave 3.8.1 and lots of people use 3.8.2 successfully.

And you are 100% sure that your "unregularized part" code there does not reference theta? I'd feel better if it looked like:

h = sigmoid stuff

J = unregularized part

theta(1) = 0

J = J + regularized part

Just on general principles ;^) ...

Giannis Milogiannakis avatar
Giannis Milogiannakis
6 years ago

1) Yes i mean "sum(theta.^2)".

and i multiple it with λ/2μ . Notice i use parenthesis at λ/(2*m).

2) I followed your idea, i put theta(1) after the unregularized part and i have the same results (-0.033).

I will try to install tomorrow 3.8.2 at my win 7 (as i know it needs an extra program) and i will let you to know. 

Thank very much for your time!

Hi, Giannis.

Now I know what I should have asked in the first place:  to run the costFunctionReg with lambda = 0 and compare that to the result from the unregularized costFunction. That would have exposed the fact that you did not copy the code from costFunction correctly. Oh, well. An educational experience for both of us ;^) ...

Hello everyone!

Everytime I try to test my sigmoid function, this error appears:

Maximum recursion limit of 500 reached. Use set(0,'RecursionLimit',N) to change the limit. Be aware that exceeding your available stack space can crash MATLAB and/or your computer.

Error in sigmoid

The only change I made in the "sigmoid.m" file was add the line:

g = sigmoid(z);

Can anyone explain me what's wrong?

Berend,

There are six separate parts of ex2 and the submit script runs them all. Perhaps this error is coming from one of the scripts you haven't tested yet. Unfortunately the output from submit strips all the useful information about which function is generating the error. Your best bet is to go through and use Tom's test cases for each one of your functions separately.

Thanks for the unit tests! They helped me out a lot. Because I didn't see an explanation about how to run the unit tests, I thought I'd chime in and show how I did it.

Octave has built in support for unit tests. You can add them at the end of you function file. More explanation can be found here: http://wiki.octave.org/Tests 

You can run your tests automatically by typing for example 'test sigmoid' in Octave, after you've added this at the end of your sigmoid file:

12345678910111213
%% Define unit tests, see also https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Test-Functions.html
%% Can be run by typing: 'test sigmoid' in Octave

%!assert (sigmoid(1200000), 1)
%!assert (sigmoid(-25000), 0)
%!assert (sigmoid(0), 0.5)

%!shared tol
%! tol = 5e-05
%!assert (sigmoid([4 5 6]), [0.9820 0.9933 0.9975], tol)

Note that tol is a variable here that specifies a tolerance in the comparison that assert makes. If you leave this out, because of rounding errors your tests will fail. Try it! And do the same for costFunction and predict. Good luck!

All you have to do to use a test case is to enter the command from the workspace, and compare the results. That's the intended method.

I was not aware of that Octave facility. Thanks for pointing this out! Here's the official Octave documentation as well:

https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Test-Functions.html#Test-Functions

I did some searching in the Matlab documentation and it appears that they have several different mechanisms to support generation of unit tests, but they are not the same as the Octave mechanism. Of course the Octave code is in the form of comments, so the presence of those lines should not interfere with the execution of the code in Matlab. Here is the Matlab documentation:

Hi everyone! Even though my codes are yielding the correct answers for the sigmoid and costFunction, I am not able to submit my answers as it returns the following message:

12
!! Submission failed: unexpected error: Undefined function or variable 'g'.

I am not sure how to solve this issue.

Let me be a bit more specific. In the sigmoid.m script, I first defined a function and just plugged z into g (which is my hypothesis). Even though I explicitly defined those two terms in my sigmoid.m script it still asks me to define variable 'g'. What is more weird is that the answers are correct as I enter the same commands on Matlab manually. My code is something like this:

123456789
% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Compute the sigmoid of each value of z (z can be 
%a matrix,
%               vector or scalar).
z = some function of covariates and parameters;
g = the hypothesis as a function of z as stated in the pdf file;

% =============================================================
end
I do all my computations in matrix form and the vector of covariates and parameters are defined in the Matlab workspace.

Paul Mielke avatar

Are you sure that you didn't modify the function declaration? The "g" should be defined there as the return value of the sigmoid function:

12
function g = sigmoid(z)

Tom Mosher avatar
Tom Mosher

7 years ago

'z' is given to your function via the parameter list. So your line "z = some function..." is totally unnecessary.

I think you have a misunderstanding of how functions work:

Data is passed to it via the parameter list

You perform some processes as necessary

The function returns one or more values.

Hi Paul, 

Thank you for the quick reply. Here is my sigmoid.m script (omitting the functions in matrix form):

123456789101112131415161718
function g = sigmoid(z)
%SIGMOID Compute sigmoid functoon
%   J = SIGMOID(z) computes the sigmoid of z.

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
g = zeros(size(z));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Compute the sigmoid of each value of z (z can be a matrix,
%               vector or scalar).

And I am pretty confident the matrix operations are correct so basically any matrix, vector or scalar could replace z.

Paul Mielke avatar
Paul Mielke

Hmmm, looks correct, modulo Tom's comment about z being the input parameter to the function. Try entering these commands into your console and "copy and paste" back the results:

123
> format long
> z = magic(3)/10
> g = sigmoid(z)
Here's what I get:

>> g = sigmoid(z)

g =

   0.689974481127613   0.524979187478940   0.645656306225795

Quote from your last message:

----------------------

 "And I am pretty confident the matrix operations are correct so basically any matrix, vector or scalar could replace z.  "

----------------------

This shows that you do not understand how this function is to work. 'z' is provided in the function call. Your job is to process 'z', and turn it into 'g'.

Then 'g' is returned by the function.

End of job.

Thank you Tom and Paul,

Maybe the error message is coming from a different script, other than sigmoid. Of course submit runs all your programs one after the other and then conveniently strips the error messages to the point that you can't tell which program is generating the error.

I Have one question... 

I've submitted the sigmoid, costFunction and gradient. Prediction function is very simple and it uses the same results from previuos functions. I've tried your suggested testing and get some tests ok and some wrong.... Where should i look? some of my results.

predict([0.3 ; 0.2], [1 2.4; 1 -17; 1 0.5])

Edvinas,

You'll need to look at the intermediate values you are getting. I instrumented my "predict" function to print out the probability values (the output of the hypothesis function) in addition to the "true/false" answer that I get by comparing >= 0.5. Here's what I get for the first test case you show:

>> predict([0.3 ; 0.2], [1 2.4; 1 -17; 1 0.5])

p =

   0.685680113938254

   0.043107254941086

   0.598687660112452

ans =

     1

     0

     1

Do you see those same "p" values? If not, then that part of your calculation must be incorrect. If those agree with mine, then the problem is in your logic for deciding whether to map those values to true or false.

Note that there is an easy vectorized way to do comparisons like this. I'll give a different example of the same idea to avoid violating the honor code. Suppose I have a vector and I want to know which elements of the vector are greater than 3.14. Try this code:

12
> v = [ 7.2; 3.04; 1; 3.16; -5 ]
> result = (v > 3.14)

I have been using equations from the video lecture.

Hi Mentors,

I have couple questions.

When doing costFunction in Ex2 do I have to put tu functions in the code? one for Cost and one fro grad? because i get the right answer for the cost= 0,693, but then i start a loop for gradient and at the end i do the call to costFuntion (in a loop) like i did in ex1, but as i understand that loop goes to the beggining and starts to calculate costs again... and this is where i got stuck...

By the way. should i get the matrix for the cost...?

thank you for your answer.

Paul Mielke avatar

Hi, Edvinas.

In this exercise, there is only one function that returns two output values:  the cost and the gradient. The cost is a scalar value and the gradient is a vector the same size and shape as the theta vector.

So for this case, you can't call the cost function from the gradient function, since they are both the same. So you have to structure the code in such a way that it calculates both results internally.

The template file gives you the function declaration with the two return parameters, so you just need to set both values before the end of the function.

Hope that helps!

Regards,

Paul

Hi, Edvinas.

I'm not sure I understand the question. If your cost function is coming out negative, are you sure you understood the formula in the PDF file correctly? Notice that there is a factor of -1 on each of the two terms being added together for the cost function (inside the big sigma).

And I am lost about what you would be using "logical or" for in this problem. Can you please explain a bit more what you mean?

Also it might help to print out your results from some of the unit tests. Have you checked your sigmoid function? There are test cases for that earlier in this thread.

There is no need to add bias units in this case. Try the following:

12
> X = [magic(3); magic(3)]
> size(X)
You'll see that the dimensions in this case are 6 x 3, right? So there are m = 6 samples, each of which has n = 3 features. So you would expect theta in this case to have dimension 3 x 1, right? As it does in the sample Vicc gave ...

For this exercise, the bias units are added by the ex2 exercise scripts. You don't add bias units inside your cost function.

Paul, I agree with what you have stated. Thought the intent was to build a unit test scaffold as close to the real exercise as possible and this would imply adding the intercept term and the corresponding gradient value. May be I misunderstood the intent.

Tom, the bias units are not added to the cost function code in my post above. They are added as part of the unit test framework. Hope I am making myself clear.
